Ok, you now how to code, it's time to start building a search engine.  



I'm serious.  As you may know search engines are built by looking at web pages and inferring page relevancy based on HTML. In 2005, Google acquired a small search engine called Aardvark, which answered users questions by connecting them with a chatbot to those they thought might have an answer.  In building Aardvark, the team had a problem: it wanted to connect not just question and answerers from the same subject but also related subjects.  For example, it needed to know that if a user had a question about cooking, but no one was available, that someone who knew about cuisine may have the answer.

How did it do that?  It scraped the data from the wikipedia page on cooking and looked to find what cooking was related to, and from there could connect some asking about cooking to someone who knew about cuisine.  Yes, not a perfect solution, but good enough to get the job done.

In this lesson we'll also use information from wikipedia to find out related topics, a topic summary, and relevant pictures of the topic.  

I'll start you off with the first one, and you can go from there.  

Take a look at the wikipedia page on (cooking)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking].
